title: Turing Fellowship
---

I am very pleased to have been awarded a fellowship by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), the UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. More details to follow on my project as it progresses, but for now [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/nik-lomax) is a link to my profile on the Turing web pages which provides a bit more information about the kinds of things I will be doing.
