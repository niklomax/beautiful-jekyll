---

The [ITRC](https://www.itrc.org.uk/about-us/itrc-mistral-strategy/) is a consortium of seven leading UK universities, investigating ways to improve the performance of infrastructure systems in the UK and around the world. Our research is helping businesses and policymakers to explore the risk of infrastructure failure and the long term benefits of investments and policies to improve infrastructure systems.

[My role](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/research-projects/itrc_mistral/) in the consortium is to produce very high resolution [demographic estimates and projections](https://www.itrc.org.uk/outputs/research-outputs/demographics/) for sector modelling teams who need to understand current and future demand. A recent presentation I gave on progress in producing [High resolution demographic projections for infrastructure planning](https://www.itrc.org.uk/itrc-in-action/multi-scale-infrastructure-transformations-an-interactive-event-from-itrc-mistral/#presentations) explains where demographics fits in to the overall MISTRAL strategy.
