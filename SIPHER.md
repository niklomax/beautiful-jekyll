[SIPHER](https://sipher.ac.uk/) is a major investment by the UK Prevention Research Partnership [(UKPRP)](https://ukprp.org/what-we-fund/sipher/) of £5 million for 5 years, with an additional £1.2 million investment from the consortium’s partners. The project brings together scientists across six universities, three government partners at local, regional and national level, and ten practice partner organisations.

SIPHER will focus on understanding the impact of interventions in four policy areas on health, wellbeing and inequalities:

- Inclusive Economic Growth
- Adverse Childhood Experiences
- Housing
- Mental Health

SIPHER’s vision is a shift from health policy to healthy public policy. This means all policy sectors working together to tackle health inequalities and improve the health of the public.
