title: The Consumer Data Research Centre
---

I am a co-Investigator on the ESRC funded Consumer Data Research Centre [(CDRC)](https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/). 
The CDRC works  with consumer organisations to make their data available to researchers. 
It is also a centre for innovative research in the UK. My current work using CDRC datasets includes work on [understanding 
housing and mobility patterns](https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/news-archive/understanding-household-mobility-nik-lomax/) using Zoopla data and work using health and lifestyle app data to [understand people's activity patterns](https://speakerdeck.com/niklomax/european-colloquium-on-quantitative-and-theoretical-human-geography).
