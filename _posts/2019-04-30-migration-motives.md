In this [paper](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol40/38/default.htm) recently published in **Demographic Research** we look at what motivates people to migrate in three countries, the UK, Australia and Sweden. We are filling a research gap because few empirical studies examining the relationship between motives and migration distance exist.

Findings are largely consistent with what we might expect, that in all three countries, housing is the most commonly cited motive to move locally. Employment is an important motive for longer-distance migration. 

Yet, interestingly, and consistent across the three national contexts, family-related considerations are shown to be key in motivating both shorter- and longer-distance moves. Family ties are rarely mentioned in the longerdistance migration literature and we suggest this motivation to move requires far more attention than it currently receives.
