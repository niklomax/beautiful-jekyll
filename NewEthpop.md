subtitle: Evaluation, Revision and Extension of Ethnic Population Projections

This project aims to understand and to forecast the ethnic transition in the United Kingdom's population at national and sub-national levels. The ethnic transition is the change in population composition from one dominated by the White British to much greater diversity. We have produced projections at local authority scale which demonstrate that as the population is growing it is becoming more ethnically diverse.
