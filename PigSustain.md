title: PigSustain: Predicting the Impacts of Intensification and Future Changes on UK Pig Industry Resilience

---

[PIGSustain](http://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=BB%2FN020790%2F1) is a BBSRC funded research project. We use a systems approach in order to understand how sustainable intensification and predicted climate changes are expected to impact on the pig industry as a whole.  We are producing models to predict the impacts of intensification on the health, disease and welfare of the animals: how consumption patterns and retail prices are likely to be affected, how these changes will impact farmers, and how these in turn will impact on the health and welfare of the animals.

My role in the PigSustain project is to produce consumer demand estimates for pork and other products which will inform the research being undertaken accross the PigSustain network.
Consumer preference will be modelled in response to changing prices, attitudeds to the consumption of meat, environmental considerations and changing demographics. The project draws on large scale consumer surveys to inform trends and projection scenarios.
